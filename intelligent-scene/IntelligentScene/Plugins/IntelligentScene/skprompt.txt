Please recommend a scene, which comprises a set of colours, for a set of Philips Hue smart lights based on the provided location within the home, the provided number of lights and a provided situation.
The situation should be the primary factor in choosing the colours for the scene, which should be immersive so it feels like the user is in the situation.
Please ensure the scene is appropriate for the situation, for example, a relaxing scene for a movie night, a bright scene for a party or a neutral scene for work-based activities.
Please ensure the brightness is appropriate for the situation, for example, a low brightness for a movie night or a high brightness for a party.
If a colour is provided in the situation please use that colour as the base colour for the scene, however, not all the lights have to be that colour.
The output should be a JSON object with the following properties:
* "name": a string property for the scene name.
* "description": a string property for an explanation of why the colours have been selected for this scene.
* "colours": a JSON array, one for each light, where each object contains the following properties:
    * "xy": an object with 2 numeric properties, "x" and "y", corresponding to the X and Y values for the colour in XY colour space.
    * "rgb": an object with 3 numeric properties, "r", "g" and "b", corresponding to the R, G and B values for the colour in RGB colour space.
    * "brightness": a numeric property for the brightness value between 0 and 100 where 0 is off and 100 is maximum.
    * "name": a string property for the colour name.
Please only respond with the JSON and no additional text.  Additional text is anything that is not the JSON data.
